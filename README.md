# champ-timer
Champ timer is a project of mine aimed to add an "MMA" theme to a podmoro timer.

Features so far:

-PODMORO Timer (25 mins) with a 5 minute break that automatically starts when the podmoro is up
-"Rounds" bar based on UFC's overlay for their live fights. Basically, every 25 minutes is a round, so by
  completing a 25 minute timer you advance a round, up to 5

-"Belt" system where every 5 rounds you complete (5 podmoro timers with breaks) you will earn a belt
  *Side note: The icon I used to represent a belt is a C in gold padding, because it's like the UFC overlay

-Pause and Resume features to let you stop or start the timer no matter what state it's in

-Reset button to let you reset everything to where it was at the start

-Notifications for when the 25 minute and 5 minute timer stops
